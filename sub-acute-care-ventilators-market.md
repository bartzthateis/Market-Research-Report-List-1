<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sub-acute Care Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Sub-acute Care Ventilators</li><li>Noninvasive Sub-acute Care Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sub-acute care ventilators are essential for patients requiring prolonged respiratory support following critical care. Invasive sub-acute care ventilators are designed for patients who need mechanical ventilation through an artificial airway, providing direct ventilation support for severe respiratory issues. Noninvasive sub-acute care ventilators, on the other hand, deliver positive pressure ventilation through facial masks or nasal interfaces, suitable for patients with less severe respiratory distress, reducing the risk of complications associated with intubation. Both types are vital for effective patient management in sub-acute settings.</p></p>
