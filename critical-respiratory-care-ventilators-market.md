<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Critical Respiratory Care Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Critical Respiratory Care Ventilators market includes two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators require intubation, delivering respiratory support directly into the lungs, making them suitable for severe cases such as respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide support without the need for intubation, using interfaces like masks to assist patients with less severe respiratory issues. Both types are essential in critical care settings, catering to varied patient needs and clinical scenarios.</p></p>
